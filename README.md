# My rental Bike

Welcome to My Rental Bike, a web application built with **React.js** and CRA that allows users to rent bikes. This application has four main functionalities:

- List the available bikes in inventory
- Search for specific bike
- Calculate the price of rentals
- Create a rental request

## Getting Started

To download the repository from GitHub, open a terminal window and run the following command:

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

This will start a local development server and open the application in your default web browser.
